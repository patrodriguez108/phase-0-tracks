4) A cookie is a piece of data that a server sends to a web browser. It's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol. A cookie relates to HTTP request because it may change the speed of a request, depending on how many cookies are stored. For example, if cookies are stored from a request to a server, if another request is made to the same server the request may process quicker than the first time because of the cookies that had been stored from the first request.
