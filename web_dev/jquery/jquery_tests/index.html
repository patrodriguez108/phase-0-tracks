<h1>Why American Gods is the show we need</h1>
<p>American Gods is a television series that premiered in May 2017 on Starz. It is based on the best-selling novel by Neil Gaiman. Showrunners include Gaiman himself, Bryan Fuller of Pushing Daisies and Hannibal fame, and Michael Green who wrote the screenplay for the critically acclaimed X-Men film Logan. It stars Ricky Whittle as Shadow, Ian McShane as Mr. Wednesday, and Emily Browning as Laura Moon.</p>
<p>I am going to tell you why it is the show that many Americans <strong>deserve</strong>.</p>
<p>American Gods is the story of a man called Shadow who gets released from prison right when he learns that his wife, Laura, has tragically died in a car crash. On the way to the funeral he gets hired by the mysterious Mr. Wednesday to be his bodyguard. Shadow begins to discover that there is more to the world than he ever thought possible.</p>
<p>Gods are real. Over the years their worshippers brought them to America in their hearts and on their backs. However as time went on the need for these gods began to dwindle. Their descendants began to dedicate themselves to facets of the modern age such as technology, media, and conspiracy. Thus rose the gods of the new world.</p>
<p>A war is brewing between the old gods and the new. A war that Shadow is caught in the middle of.</p>
<p>Aside from this largely fascinating plot of ideologies within the frame of immigration and the generations that passed, American Gods is worth watching for another reason. It largely features representation of folks that are not typically represented in television or film. The series features complex and dynamic characters who are part of their respective marginalized groups, as well as having fascinating stories that draw you in:
<ul>
<li>Shadow, the central character, is played by a Black man.</li>
<li>Salim (played by Omid Abtahi) is a gay Muslim man. He shares a romance with a god only known as the Jinn (played by Mousa Kraish).</li>
<li>Bilquis (played by Yetide Badaki) is an African love goddess who gains worshippers in her own way.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a select few examples of the representations that are featured in American Gods. Representation in media is important to many Americans, myself included. Being a part of two different marginalized groups, it is hard to find media in which I can see proper reflections of myself. This is why American Gods is very important. This is why we deserve American Gods.
</p>
<p>There are many different ways to watch American Gods:
<ol>
<li>Starz, the premium cable network</li>
<li>The Starz app</li>
<li>Amazon Prime</li>
</ol>
