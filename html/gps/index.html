The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to clearly define content to both the browser and the user. I would say that the most useful semantic tag is < nav > because it can be used to create the webpage's navigation so that the user may be able to properly browse about the website in the browser and still be able to access the other pages.

The order that the browser uses to display elements on a page is < html > because without it then the html code cannot be processed.

I learned that Sublime is a very user friendly software with the feature of creating snippets. I do believe that I will create more snippets in the future because there are some tags that require a lot of typing and it would be useful to create snippets for them.

What I found the most difficult in this challenge was snippets. When researching snippets I could not find the proper resources to gain information. When Ben sent the proper resource, I was still at a loss on what snippets were actually for as the page didn't explicitly state the definition nor what they are used for. Ben had to state to me what they are and how they are used. After that it took me quite a while to figure out how to structure a snippet, and after I structured a snippet it took me a bit to understand how to save a snippet. I believe that I have a fair understanding of snippets now, but I believe I can improve my understanding of snippets by continually using snippets.
