# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is the creation of multiple iterations of the same code and files that are to be updated. It is useful because it preserves the original data, reduces the likelihood of error, as well as streamlines work flows by enabling multiple parties to work on the same code and files.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of the master folder in git. I would use one so that I could update my code while still preserving the original version of the same code in the master folder, so that I may reference it and/or preserve it in case of any sort of error in the branch folder.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit a message in a log that record any changes made within a git branch folder. A good commit is specific and apparently uses present tense rather than past tense.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is a stituation in which Git would prevent a merge from occurring. This could happen when attempting to merge files when two different coders may have edited the same line differently or if one coder deleted a line while another coder added to the same line.
