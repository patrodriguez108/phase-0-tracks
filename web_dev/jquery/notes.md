Release 1

I found that what was effective was looking through the resources I had saved, and reading through what I can do with jQuery. I looked at the examples of how to write the code to perform fades or to hide specific elements. After I gained some familiarity with the syntax, I mimicked it and adjusted my code where I found it wasn't working.
